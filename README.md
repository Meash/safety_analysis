#Exercises for the class *Safety Analysis*
######University of Augsburg

##About this repository
To control railway crossings, the Deutsche Bahn is interested in a novel approach which uses wireless communication between the train and the crossing to secure the passing of the train.

We search for possible hazards (i.e. train on unsecured crossing) and their causes using techniques such as the Fault Tree Analysis and the FMEA.

Ultimately, we model the behaviour of the system in program graphs which are then transformed to a NuSMV specification.
We extend the specification and add safety checks in LTL or CTL which are then model-checked by NuSMV.
We also perform a DCCA and find all minimally critical sets of failures.
